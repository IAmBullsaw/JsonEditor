    "card.py is responsible for the data this card holds, such as this text, paths to header image and the possibility to hold even more pictures (However I have not implemented this in any card. (Yet...))",
    "After building a cardclass I began building the website implementation in Flask. This part was actually really fun since I've been working with Flask before and everything just came together, but as a horrible eye-sore since no CSS were applied. That was the next step.",
    "I think I wrestled with the CSS like a madman. I have yet to try out Less, Sass and all those really nice tools. I just went at it like a caveman. After an insane amount of headache inducing 'width: 100%', I found out that the smart thing is to divide the website in rows and columns. This helped an insane amount with the overall size issues I had... We should however not talk about designing mobile-friendly websites. That is a thing of this sites future.",
    "To make the cards act like I wanted them to I had to use Javascript. Before I continue to ramble on and on, I feel like I have to tell you that I never intended to use Javascript for a website. Somehow it feels that a website only gets more complicated to use when one needs to take this magical tool in use. However, I wanted to try this card-thing out!",
    "So, I made one function to 'flip over' and show its back. With some CSS magic I made it grow into a larger thing, the one you're reading now. I am still not sure if this is a good move. It was however fun and some of my friends actually said 'Hey, that is nice'. I am already thinking about a simpler website design, but scrolling sideways, that's something else, isn't it?",
    "Well well. Next thing to implement here, besides one of the million things I want to do, is the mobile-friendly css. I am however surprised that the side-scrolling magically works 'At least on my machine'-style."
