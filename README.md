# JsonEditor

For me this is just a simple tool to save my projects and edit them.

For my website, my projects are stored in the JSON format. I was already tired after writing two in my favourite editor Spacemacs :heart: so... I built this editor with the help from QT.

## Features
It can open my data.json and display my projects in a list.

I can click on a project to edit it or click a button named 'new' to create a new project.

If i edit a card and exit, it will ask if I'd like to save or exit. If i've edited a project and saved it and then try to exit, I am asked if a i do not care about my edits.
So yeah, editing a card and editing the whole file is seperate things in this editor, found it easier with the "Are you sure you want to exit when you have ..."-messages.
